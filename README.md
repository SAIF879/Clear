# CLEAR ðŸ¤–

## Discription 
Clear App is an Android application. It offers users three main features: note-taking, to-do list management, and a dictionary. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and employs Jetpack Compose for the user interface, providing a modern and responsive experience.

## Features
Note-taking
Users can create and save notes using the app.
The notes are stored securely in the app's local database using Room.
A "Create Notes" screen allows users to jot down their thoughts and ideas, and an "Edit Notes" screen allows them to modify and update their notes as needed.
Users can also attach images to their notes, providing a richer experience.


## To-Do List Management

Users can manage their to-do list with the app.
To-do items can be marked as completed or uncompleted.
Completed to-do items are showcased in a separate "Completed To-Do" screen for easy reference.

## Dictionary
The app acts as a dictionary, providing users with word meanings and pronunciation.
API results are fetched through Retrofit, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
Users can bookmark saved words and access their search history, which is maintained using Room.
